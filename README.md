Welcome to the <bold>"Multi-model Image Fusion"</bold> GitHub repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for merging information from multiple imaging sources to enhance the overall quality and interpretability of images. 
<br></h1>

  ### Problem Statement:
  
The challenge lies in effectively fusing MRI and CT scans due to the absence of standardized techniques, leading to diagnostic inaccuracies and limited treatment planning. Developing robust fusion methods, like DWT and Pixel-Based Fusion, is crucial to preserve essential features from both modalities and improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging.

<h1>Multimodality Image Fusion refers to the process of integrating data from multiple imaging sources, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, to generate a single fused image that preserves the complementary features of each

<h1>Anatomical coordinate system:</h1> 
The most important model coordinate system for medical imaging techniques is the anatomical space (also called the patient coordinate system). This space consists of three planes to describe the standard anatomical position of a human:

[1] The axial plane

[2] The sagittal plane

[3] The coronal plane

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the image fusion project successfully implemented DWT and pixel-based fusion methods for combining MRI and CT scans. The evaluation using the PSNR metric revealed the effectiveness of both methods in preserving essential image features. Pixel-based fusion demonstrated superior performance, achieving a higher PSNR value and offering enhanced image quality compared to DWT fusion. The project's outcomes underscore the significance of multimodality image fusion techniques in medical imaging, facilitating improved diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility.
